Noise in solar datasets significantly hampers the accuracy of model constraints. With the advent of machine learning (ML), innovative denoising techniques have emerged as promising tools to enhance data quality. This project explores the use of a convolutional neural network Machine learning-based denoising methods developed and demonstrated  to different solar datasets, for MaGIXS calibration datasets. For this project, we have considered the denoising method established to analyze data from the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST) [Diaz Bazo et al, 2019], learn how the model works,adapt the framework and  attempt an equivalent training  model to work for MaGIXS datasets. Here, we present a summary of the preliminary groundwork to run the denoising algorithm for SST datasets and discuss the prospects to train for MaGIXS data.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4098f4b6-6014-472d-aacf-e83bcdb590d5)
